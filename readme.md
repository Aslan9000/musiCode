Node Express MVC Application with Login and Autentication

This is a simple web app that allows the user to input their name(single),a scale, and key to obtain a corresponding output of music. This music is made in the midi format. If this app is expanded, it would in the future include download capabilities, allowing users to import their self-created midi musical name into the audio software of their choice. For now, they can only obtain instant feedback with the built-in player to hear their creation. 

This project uses: 
Node Js
Express
MongoDB
Bootstrap
Webpack
Axios
midi-player-js
midi-writer-js
soundfont-player
