Node Express MVC Application with Login and Autentication


*Note: This site is published on Render.com. It is in the free tier so the website will loading slowly and some features may hang, after 15 minutes of inactivity. However once accessed, it will work normally before the next inactivity period is reached. 

This is a simple web app that allows the user to input their name(single),a scale, and key to obtain a corresponding output of music. This music is made in the midi format. If this app is expanded, it would in the future include download capabilities, allowing users to import their self-created midi musical name into the audio software of their choice. For now, they can only obtain instant feedback with the built-in player to hear their creation. 

This project uses: 
Node Js
Express
MongoDB
Bootstrap
Webpack
Axios
midi-player-js
midi-writer-js
soundfont-player
